##  Q1. User vs Computer TicTacToe with min-max and alpha-beta pruning  
###  Methodology:  
Both min-max and alpha-beta pruning have been implemented with no randomisation.
i.e if at any point, there are two states with the same utility value, the algorithm will choose
the state that occurs first.  

No memoization is done, so the computer calculates all steps everytime.

By default, the computer uses only min-max strategy without alpha-beta pruning. To use alpha-beta
pruning, pass the `--alphabeta` switch.

#### Usage:
To use the program and play against it, type:
```bash
python PA2_2016118_Viresh_Gupta_minmax.py
```
To give input from a file instead of choosing steps interactively:
```bash
python PA2_2016118_Viresh_Gupta_minmax.py < user_moves.txt
```
To use alpha-beta pruning, use:
```bash
python PA2_2016118_Viresh_Gupta_minmax.py --alphabeta
```

### Experiments:
I calculated the time taken for each algorithm, by using the unix `time` command.
e.g
```bash
time python PA2_2016118_Viresh_Gupta_minmax.py < user_moves.txt
time python PA2_2016118_Viresh_Gupta_minmax.py --alphabeta < user_moves.txt
```

### Observations:

+---------+----------+-------------+
| time    | Min-Max  | Alpha-Beta  |
+=========+==========+=============+
|real     | 0m 1.293s| 0m 0.132s   |
+----------------------------------+
|user     | 0m 1.280s| 0m 0.109s   |
+----------------------------------+
|sys      | 0m 0.012s| 0m 0.020s   |
+----------------------------------+

### Inference:
Thus, we can observe that the time taken when using alpha-beta pruning strategy for making a decision is considerably smaller, and
the alpha-beta strategy is giving a big boost to the decision making (~ 10 times).

##  Q2. Course time scheduling using CSPs and GAs / MAs

a. Logical constraints on the given problem:  
    - No professor is teaching at two places at a time.
    - Only one course is taught at a venue at a time.
    - A course has class only once a week, in one of the given time slots
    - The institute is a basic CS institute, where each professor has knowledge of each domain, so
      they can teach any course floated at the institute.
